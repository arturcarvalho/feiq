# TypeScript

## Variables and values

<Question>
  <Title>What are the types of the variable x and y?</Title>  
  
  ```ts 
  let x = "hi";
  const y = "hi" 
  ```
  
  <Answer>
    x is of type string and y is "hi". This happens because `const` can't change
    so the only value possible is "hi". [It's a literal
    type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#literal-types).
  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
<Title>NaN as a number: Will it compile?</Title>

```ts
let n = 5;
n = NaN;
```

  <Answer>
    Yes, `NaN` will compile. `NaN` is a number in JavaScript.
  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>Literal type: Will this compile?</Title>

```ts
let a = 30;
function func(num: 30) {} // ðŸ‘€
func(a);
```

<Answer>
No, this won't compile. The function only accepts `num` where the value is 30.
</Answer>
</Question>

## Objects

<Question>
<Title>Optional properties: Does it compile?</Title>

```ts
type AB = {
  a?: number;
  b: number;
};

const x: AB = { b: 1 };
x.a = undefined;
x.a = 1;

interface CD {
  c?: number;
  d: number;
}

const y: CD = { d: 1 };
y.c = undefined;
y.c = 1;
```

  <Answer>
   Yes, the code above compiles.

An optional property (ending with `?`) will accept the `undefined` value too.
By default, before initializing a property it has the undefined value, so there's no need to initialize for instance `a` when assigning an object to the variable `x`.

Interfaces and types work the same way regarding optional properties.

  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>Index signatures: Will it compile?</Title>
 
  ```ts
  type Boat = { size: number }
  type Marina = { [k: string]: Boat }

  let marina: Marina = {}
  marina.titanic.size = 300; // Notice property titanic was not defined
  marina.mcBoat.size = 30;
  ```
  <Answer>
    Yes, it will compile.

    But if you run the code, it will throw an error because `titanic` is not defined.
  </Answer>
</Question>

## Arrays

<Question>
  <Title>Push vs assign: Does it show errors on line A or B?</Title>

```ts
let tuple: [number, number] = [1, 2];
tuple.push(3); // A
tuple = [1, 2, 3]; // B
```

  <Answer>
  It shows errors on line B.

   - Line A: No errors. Because tuples are regular arrays at runtime.
   - Line B: Errors. Because the variable tuple only accepts tuples with 2 numbers.
  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>Defining array types: Which lines don't compile?</Title>

  ```ts
  let arr1:string[] // A
  let arr2:[string] // B
  let arr3:Array<string> // C
  ```
  <Answer>
    Line `B` won't compile.

    This is not a valid syntax to define arrays. Notice line `C` will show `string[]` type and not `Array<string>`.
  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>What is the type of mixedArray?</Title>

  ```ts
  const mixedArray = [1, "Bob"]
  ```
  <Answer>
    The type is `(number | string)[]`. 

    TypeScript can infer the possible types from the contents of the array.
  </Answer>
</Question>

## Types

<Question>
<Title>Types: Will they merge?</Title>

```ts
type Boat = {
  color: string;
};

type Boat {
engine: boolean;
}

```

  <Answer>
   No, types don't merge. This causes a `duplicate identifier` error.
  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
<Title>Type objects: Can they be partially created?</Title>

```ts
type Boat = {
  color: string;
};

let b: Boat = {};
```

  <Answer>
   No, the `Boat` object needs to always conform to the `Boat` type. If you need to partially build an object, you can use the utility `Partial` and then use a type guard to make sure the object is completely built.
  </Answer>
</Question>

## Union types

<Question>
<Title>Union: Does it compile?</Title>

```ts
type Result = Error | 42;
let r: Result = new Error("boom");
r = 42;
```

  <Answer>
    Yes, it compiles.
  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
<Title>Union ðŸ‘€: Does it compile?</Title>

```ts
type Result = string | number;
let r = "banana"; // ðŸ‘€
r = 42;
```

  <Answer>
    No, it doesn't compile. The danger of implicit typing is that sometimes you might forget to add them. This works:

```ts
type Result = string | number;
let r: Result = "banana"; // Notice r is explicitly typed with `Result`
r = 42;
```

  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
<Title>Derived types: What is the type of `a`?</Title>

```ts
type Res = ["error", Error] | ["ok", string];

function f(): Res {
  return Math.random() >= 0.5
    ? ["error", Error("boom")]
    : ["ok", "some message"];
}

const [a] = f();
```

  <Answer>
    The type of the variable `a` is `"error" | "ok"`. TypeScript can calculate the type for you.
  </Answer>
</Question>

## Intersection types and Interfaces

<Question>
<Title>Intersecting types of objects: Does it compile?</Title>

```ts
type T1 = {
  a: string;
};

type T2 = {
  b: number;
};

let c: T1 & T2;
c = { a: "a", b: 1 };
```

  <Answer>
    Yes, it compiles. Intersections create a type that is the combination of both types.
  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>Intersecting primitive types: Does it compile?</Title>

```ts
let c: string & null;
c = "hi";
```

  <Answer>
    No, it doesn't compile.

    `c` is of type `never` because something cannot work as type `string` and type `null`. The types are in conflict.

  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>Will the interfaces merge?</Title>

```ts
interface Boat {
  color: string;
}

interface Boat {
  engine: boolean;
}
const b = { color: "white", engined: true };
```

<Answer>
 Yes. The interfaces merge and there are no errors. The variable `b` complies with the interface `Boat`.
</Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
<Title>Does it compile? interface vs type</Title>

```ts
type Boat = {
  color: string;
};

interface Boat {
  engine: boolean;
}
```

  <Answer>
   No, because there's a duplicate identifier `Boat`. And you can't merge interfaces with types.
  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>Types vs Interfaces: Will line A and/or B compile?</Title>

  ```ts
  type AType = {
    prop: string;
  }

  type BType = {
    prop: number;
  }

  type CType = AType & BType; // A
  type MyProp = CType['prop']

  interface AInterface {
    prop: string;
  }

  interface BInterface {
    prop: number;
  }

  interface CInterface extends AInterface, BInterface { // B
  }
  ```
  <Answer>
    Line `A` compiles, but line `B` doesn't compile.

    Currently, extending interfaces catches more conflicts than type intersections.

## Narrowing (guards)

<Question>
  <Title>Rounding number: Will it compile?</Title>

```ts
function f(n: number | string) {
  n.toFixed(2);
}
```

  <Answer>
    No, it won't compile. The `n` must be narrowed to a single type. Like this:
    ```ts
    function f(n: number | string) {
      if (typeof n === "number") n.toFixed(2)
    }
    ```
  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>Null or: What is the type n on line A?</Title>

```ts
function f(n: string | string[] | null) {
  if (n && typeof n === "object") {
    console.log(n); // A
  }
}
```

  <Answer>
    The type of `n` is `string[]`.

    You have to check if `n` is truthy because `typeof null` is `object`.
    This means that if the variable is `null` or `string[]`, it will have the type "object".

  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>Equality narrowing: What's the type of x in line A?</Title>

```ts
function f(x: string | number, y: string | object) {
  if (x === y) {
    x; // A
  }
}
```

  <Answer>
    The type of `x` is `string`.

    If 2 variables are equal (by using `===`), then both variables must be of the same type.
    In this case, the only possibility is to be `string`.

  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>Loose equality narrowing: What's the type of x in line A?</Title>

```ts
function f(x: boolean | null | undefined) {
  if (x == null) {
    x; // A
  }
}
```

  <Answer>
    The type of `x` is `null | undefined`.

    It's possible to narrow types by using loose equality.
    If you loosely compare a value to null, it can be `null` or  `undefined` like in the case above.

  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>in narrowing: What's the type of x in line A?</Title>

```ts
type Boat = { engine: string };
type Car = { color: string };

function f(x: Boat | Car) {
  if ("engine" in x) {
    x; // A
  }
}
```

  <Answer>
    The type of `x` is `Boat`.

    It's possible to narrow types by using the `in` operator.

  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>instanceof narrowing: What's the type of x in line A?</Title>

```ts
class Boat {
  constructor(public name: string) {}
}

function f(x: Boat | string) {
  if (x instanceof Boat) {
    x; // A
  }
}
```

  <Answer>
    The type of `x` is `Boat`.

    It's possible to narrow types by using the `instanceof` operator.

  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>type guard: What is ??? to make the code work?</Title>

```ts
type Boat = { name: string }

function isBoat(value: any): value ??? Boat {
    return value && "name" in value;
}
let maybeBoat: unknown

if(isBoat(maybeBoat)) {
    maybeBoat // A maybeBoat is Boat
}
```

  <Answer>
    `???` is the keyword `is`, a type guard.
  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>type guard assertion: What is the type of `maybeBoat` in line A?</Title>

```ts
type Boat = { make: string; model: string };

function assertIsBoat(valueToTest: any): asserts valueToTest is Boat {
  const cond =
    valueToTest &&
    typeof valueToTest === "object" &&
    "make" in valueToTest &&
    typeof valueToTest["make"] === "string" &&
    "model" in valueToTest &&
    typeof valueToTest["model"] === "string";

  if (!cond) throw new Error("Value is not a Boat");
}

let maybeBoat: unknown;
assertIsBoat(maybeBoat);
maybeBoat; // A
```

  <Answer>
    The type of `maybeBoat` is `Boat`.
    Although if you run the code, it will thrown an error because `maybeBoat` is udnefined.
  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>type guard assertion: What is the type of `car` in line A?</Title>

```ts
type Boat = { make: string; model: string };
type Car = { seats: number };

function assertIsBoat(valueToTest: any): asserts valueToTest is Boat {
  const cond = valueToTest && typeof valueToTest === "object";
  if (!valueToTest) throw new Error("Value is not a Boat");
}

let car: Car = { seats: 4 };
assertIsBoat(car);
car; // A
```

  <Answer>
    The type of `car` is `Car & Boat`.

    Even when the assertion is not good (like in the code above) TypeScript will trust you.

  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>Can you assign a less strict value to a variable?</Title>

```ts
function g(n: number | null) {
  const num: number = n;
}
```

<Answer>
  No, the code won't compile. Because you can't assign a value that is less strict. And in this case the value `n` accepts `number` or `null` while `num` only accepts numbers.

But you can assign a more strict value to a less strict variable:

```ts
function f(n: number) {
  const num: number | null = n;
}
```

```js
 export default ({ children }) => <PageLayout>{children}</PageLayout>;

  ```ts
  interface TwoNumsFn {
    // A

<Question>
  <Title>Non-null assertion operator: Will the code compile?</Title>

```ts
type Boat = {
  location?: { country: string }; // Notice it's optional
};

const b: Boat = {};
b.location!.country = "Luxembourg";
```

  <Answer>
    Yes, the code will compile.

    But it will throw an error during runtime because `b.location` is `undefined`.

</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>Definite Assignment Operator: Will the code compile?</Title>

```ts
class C {
  x!: number;

The `x!` will suppress any errors even if the class field was not initialized.

  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>Can a function typed to return only undefined compile?</Title>

  ```ts
    function f(n: number): undefined {      
      return undefined;
    }
  ```
  <Answer>
    Yes. If you explicitly return `undefined`.
  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>What should you write instead of __ so that you can ignore the return value of a function?</Title>

  ```ts
    function f():___ {

  <Answer>
    The keyword `void`. 
  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>Does the code compile for a function that has no return values but has undefined as return type?</Title>

  ```ts
  function f(): undefined {
      console.log(1)
  }

  console.log(f()) // Logs "undefined"
  ```
  <Answer>
    No, the code won't compile.

    Even though functions that don't have return statements return `undefined`, 
    when we say the function is going to return `undefined` there needs to be somewhere an explicit `undefined` return.
  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>What is the return type when nothing is returned and the function has no return type?</Title>

  ```ts
 function f() {}

</Question>

## Classes
<Question>
  <Title>Will the class with Promise on constructor show errors?</Title> 
  
  ```ts
    class Boat {
      color: string
      engine: boolean
      constructor(color: string) {
        this.color = color
        Promise.resolve().then(()=> this.engine = true)
      }
    }
  ```
  <Answer>    
   Yes, there is an error because engine is not initialized. 
   
   The constructor is initializing the `engine` field but not immediately. This means users of class `Boat` are not guaranteed to have the `engine` field initialized.
  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>Does the abstract class compile?</Title> 
  
  ```ts
  // abstract classes are like "half a class".
  // In the case below, classes that extend Boat must implement the `engine` field.
  abstract class Boat {
    public abstract engine: string
    color: "white"
  }
  class Titanic extends Boat {
    public engine: string | string[] = ["big engine", "small engine"]
  }
  ```

  <Answer>
   No, it will not compile. The `engine` field has to be compatible with the abstract class. 
  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>Does the constrained abstract class work?</Title> 
  
  ```ts
  abstract class Boat {
    public abstract color: string
  }
  class Titanic extends Boat {
    public color: "white" = "white" // Notice the literal type
  }
  ```

  <Answer>
   Yes, it will work without errors. 
   
   You can constrain a type but you can't relax it. The `color` in `Titanic` can only be the string "white".
  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>

<Title>Does the class with public on constructor compile?</Title>

```ts
type Boat = {
  color: string;
};

class Titanic implements Boat {
  constructor(public color: string) {}
}
```

  <Answer>
   Yes, it will compile. A new Boat object will have the field `color`.

The public syntax is shorthand for the typical object initialization. This is [class property inference from constructors](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-0-beta/#class-property-inference). The code above is the same as this:

```ts
type Boat = {
  color: string;
};

class Titanic implements Boat {
  color: string;
  constructor(color: string) {
    this.color = color;
  }
}
```

  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>Will the class and interface merge?</Title>

```ts
class Boat {
  color: string = "white";
}

export interface Boat {
  engine: string;
}

const p = new Boat();
p.color;
p.engine;
```

  <Answer>
   No, and it will not compile. If a part of a merged declaration is exported, all the parts must be exported.

To make it work, remove the `export` from the code above. It will also work if you add export to the class:

```ts
export class Boat {
  color: string = "white";
}

export interface Boat {
  engine: string;
}

const p = new Boat();
p.color;
p.engine;
```

</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>Will the same private field compile?</Title>

```ts
class Boat {
  private engine: number;
  constructor(engine: number) {
    this.engine = engine;
  }
}

class Titanic extends Boat {
  private engine: number;
  constructor(engine: number) {
    super(engine);
    this.engine = engine;
  }
}
```

  <Answer>
   No, it won't compile. *"Types have separate declarations of a private property 'engine'"*

This happens because private fields are public at runtime. So both fields can be accessed and that creates a conflict.

  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>Will the same private field (#) compile?</Title>

```ts
class Boat {
  #engine: number;
  constructor(engine: number) {
    this.#engine = engine;
  }
}

class Titanic extends Boat {
  #engine: number;
  constructor(engine: number) {
    super(engine);
    this.#engine = engine;
  }
}
```

<Answer>
 Yes, this code will compile. Contrary to the `private` keyword, private hashed times (e.g. `#engine`) are private at runtime.
</Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>Property not initialized: Does it compile?</Title> 
  
  ```ts
    class Boat {
      color: string
      engine: boolean
      constructor(color: string) {
        this.color = color
      }
    }
  ```
  <Answer>
   No, this doesn't compile. Because the `engine` property has no initializer and it's not defined on the constructor.
  </Answer>
</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>Function calling this: Does it compile?</Title>

```ts
type Boat = {
  engines: string[];
};

function findEngine(engine: string) {
  return this.engines.indexOf(engine) !== -1;
}
```

  <Answer>
   No, it won't compile.

There is an assumption that `this` has an `engines` field. But `this` could be anything, so we cannot assume that.
We can fix it by defining the type of `this`:

```ts
  type Boat = {
    engines: string[];
  };

  function findEngine(this: Boat, engine: string) {
    return this.engines.indexOf(engine) !== -1;
  }
```

  }

  const b = new Boat(1,1,1,1)
  b.f1 // A
  b.f2 // B
  b.f3 // C
  b.f4 // D

  <Answer>
    C and D won't compile. 
    A compiles because `public` is the default access modifier.

  b.f1 // A
  b.f2 // B
  b.f3 // C

<Question>
  <Title>Access modifiers: Which lines won't compile?</Title>

  ```ts
  class Boat {
      constructor(public f1: number, protected f2: number, private f3: number) { }

  }

  const t = new Titanic(1, 1, 1) 

  t.f1 // D
  t.f2 // E
  t.f3 // F
  ```
  <Answer>
    The lines C, E and F.

    The `protected` field is only accessible from within the subclasses of `Boat`.

</Question>


<Question>
  <Title>readonly field: Will there be type errors on A or B?</Title>

  ```ts
  class Boat {
      readonly f1: number;
      constructor(f1: number) {
          this.f1 = f1; // A
      }
  }

  const b = new Boat(1)
  b.f1 = 2 // B
  ```
  <Answer>
    There will be an error on B.

    Readonly fields can be initialized on the constructor. Remember, there won't be any runtime check.

</Question>

<Question>
  <Title>Are excess properties checked?</Title>

```ts
  interface Boat {
    color: string;
  }

  function logBoat(mcBoat: Boat) {
    console.log(mcBoat);
  }

  logBoat({ color: "white", engine: false });
```

<Answer>
 The code above **won't compile**.
 
 Excess properties are checked for object literals.
 The reason is `logBoat` is receiving an object literal with a field (`engine`) that will never be used.

It would work if the variable could be used for something else. This works:

```ts
interface Boat {
  color: string;
}

function logBoat(mcBoat: Boat) {
  console.log(mcBoat);
}

const reusableVar = { color: "white", engine: false };

// This is valid because reusableVar can be used in some other context
logBoat(reusableVar);
```

  ```ts
  function f___(arr: T[]): T {
      return arr[0];
  }
  const first = f([1, 2])

  const arr: ___<number> = []
  arr.push(1)
  ```
  <Answer>
  The word to use is `Array`.

  Consider that `Array<some_type>` is the same as `some_type[]`.

  <Title>Multiple generic types: What is the type of x?</Title>

  ```ts
  interface Small<T, U> {
      f1: T;
      f2: U;
  }

  function f<T, U>(x: T, y: U): Small<T, U> {
      return { f1: x, f2: y }
  }

  const x = f(1, "a")
  ```
  <Answer>
  The type of `x` is `Small<number, string>`.

  <Title>Generic arrow functions: Which line won't produce compilation errors?</Title>

  ```ts
  const identity = <T>(val: T) => val // A
  const identity = (val: T)<T> => val // B
  identity(3) // returns 3
  ```
  <Answer>
  Line `A`. 
  
  Like in regular functions, the generic type definition comes before the parentheses for the parameters.

  <Title>Narrowed generic: Will the code compile?</Title>

  ```ts
  const id = <T>(val: T) => val
  id(1) // A
  id<string>(1) // B
  ```

  <Answer>
  The code won't compile on line `B`.

  Because you narrowed the type of the function (by passing `<string>`) you will get a compilation error warning you the argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.

<Question>
  <Title>Generic Promise: Will the code compile?</Title>

  ```ts
  const sleep = <T>(val: T, ms: number) => {
      return new Promise<T>((res) => setTimeout(() => res(val), ms))
  }

  sleep<number>("hey", 2000).then((val) => console.log(val))
  ```
  <Answer>
  The code won't compile.

  To make it compile, you'd have to change the sleep call to accept strings. Like so:
  ```ts
  sleep<string>("hey", 2000)
  ```

<Question>
  <Title>Will the code compile if strictNullChecks is set to false?</Title>

  ```ts
  // strictNullChecks = false
  let x: boolean = null;
  let y: boolean = undefined;
  ```
  <Answer>
  The code will compile. 

  `null` and `undefined` are considered a subtype of any type when `--stricthNullChecks` is set to false.
  This means type `T` and `T | undefined` or `T | null` are [considered synonymous](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-0.html).
